# Off-by-One Error and ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java
This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java that leads to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The `Bug.java` file contains the erroneous code.  The solution is provided in `BugSolution.java`.

The bug is caused by an incorrect loop condition that goes beyond the valid indices of the array.  Understanding array indexing is crucial in Java to avoid these runtime exceptions.
